        <h1>Video Terminology</h1>
        <p>The following terms are used throughout the video documentation. For a detailed list of GNSDK terms and definitions, see the <span class="SystemGlossaryTitle">Glossary</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><strong>Video Work</strong> - A Work refers to the artistic creation and production of a Film, TV Series, or other form of video content. The same Work can be released on multiple Product formats across territories. For example, The Dark Knight Work can be released on a Blu-ray Product in multiple countries. A TV Series such as Lost is also a Work. Each individual episode comprising the Series is also a unique Work. Although the majority of Works are commercially released as a Product, not all Works have a Product counterpart. For example, a TV episode which airs on TV, but is not released on DVD or Blu-ray is considered a Work to which no Product exists.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><strong>Video Product</strong> - A Product refers to the commercial release of a Film, TV Series, or video content. Products contain a unique commercial code such as a UPC (Univeral Product Code), Hinban, or EAN (European Article Number). Products are for the most part released on a physical format, such as a DVD or Blu-ray.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><strong>Video Disc</strong> - A video disc can be either DVD (Digital Video Disc) or Blu-ray. DVD is an optical disc storage format, invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than Compact Discs while having the same dimensions. Blu-ray is an optical disc format designed to display high definition video and store large amounts of data. The name Blu-ray Disc refers to the blue laser used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><strong>Video Side</strong> - Both DVDs and Blu-ray discs can be dual side. Double-Sided discs include a single layer on each side of the disc that data can be recorded to. Double-Sided recordable DVDs come in two formats: DVD-R and DVD+R, including the rewritable DVD-RW and DVD+RW.  These discs can hold about 8.75GB of data if you burn to both sides. Dual-side Blu-ray discs can store 50 GB of data (25GB on each side).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p><strong>Video Layer</strong> - Both DVDs and Blu-ray Discs can be dual layer. These discs are only writable on one side of the disc, but contain two layers on that single side for writing data to. Dual-Layer recordable DVDs come in two formats: DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL.  They can hold up to 8.5GB on the two layers. Dual-layer Blu-ray discs can store 50 GB of data (25GB on each layer).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
