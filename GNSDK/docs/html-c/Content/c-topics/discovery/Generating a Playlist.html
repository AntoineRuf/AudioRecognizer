        <h1>Generating a Playlist</h1>
        <p>Generating a Playlist involves the following general steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Create a new Playlist collection summary.</li>
            <li value="2">Populate the collection summary with unique identifiers and GDOs.</li>
            <li value="3">(Optional) Store the collection summary.</li>
            <li value="4">(Optional) Load the stored collection summary into memory in preparation for Playlist results generation.</li>
            <li value="5">Generate a playlist, using the More Like This function with a seed.</li>
            <li value="6">Access and display playlist results.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To generate a custom playlist, use the Playlist Definition Language. For more information, see <a href="../advanced_topics/Playlist PDL Specification.html" class="GNBasic MCXref xref xrefGNBasic">Playlist PDL Specification</a>.</p>
        <h2>Creating a Collection Summary</h2>
        <p>To create a collection summary, call the following function:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_collection_create("sample_collection", &amp;playlist_collection);</pre>
        <p>This creates a new and empty collection summary. The function returns a pointer to a collection handle, which can be used in subsequent calls.</p>
        <p class="note"><span class="note">Note:</span> Each new collection summary that you want to save must have a unique name, or the previously saved summary with the same name will be overwritten. </p>
        <h2>Populating a Collection Summary</h2>
        <p>The main task in building a Playlist collection summary is to provide all possible data to the Playlist for each specific media item. The API to provide data for a collection summary is gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo(). This API takes a media identifier (any unique string determined by the application) and a <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">GDO<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Gracenote Data Object: Containers most-commonly used to store information returned by a query. GDOs can contain metadata values (names, titles, external IDs, and so on) that can be accessed by an application using Value keys.  GDOs can also contain references to other GDOs, which can be accessed using Child GDO keys.</span></a> to acquire data from. The GDO should come from a recognition event from the other <span class="GNVariablesProductName">GNSDK for Desktop</span> modules (such as MusicID or MusicID-File).</p>
        <h3>Enabling Playlist Attributes</h3>
        <p>When creating a MusicID or MusicID-File query to populate a playlist, you must set the following query options with the appropriate function (for example, gnsdk_musicid_query_option_set() for the MusicID&#160;module)&#160;to ensure that the appropriate Playlist attributes are returned (depending on the type of query):</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>GNSDK_MUSICID_OPTION_ENABLE_SONIC_DATA or GNSDK_MUSICIDFILE_OPTION_ENABLE_SONIC_DATA</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">GNSDK_MUSICID_OPTION_ENABLE_PLAYLIST or GNSDK_MUSICIDFILE_OPTION_ENABLE_PLAYLIST</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adding Data to a Collection Summary</h3>
        <p>You can add an identifier to a collection using gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_ident(). This function creates an empty entry in the collection summary for the given identifier. An application provides an identifier that allows the application to identify referenced physical media. Identifiers are not interpreted by Playlist, but are only returned to the application in Playlist results. Identifiers are application dependent. For example, a desktop application might use a full path to a file name, while an online application might use a database key. Once you have added an identifier, an application can add data to it using the other gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_*() APIs. </p>
        <p>For example, after retrieving GDOs with a query, use the gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo() function to add the GDOs  to the collection summary. As shown below, you might call the function with an album or track GDO (or both), depending on your use case:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo(playlist_collection, unique_ident, album_gdo);</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo(playlist_collection, unique_ident, track_gdo);</pre>
        <p class="note"><span class="note">Note:</span> You can add multiple GDOs for the same identifier by calling the gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo() API multiple times with the same identifier value. The data gathered from all the provided GDOs is stored for the given identifier. The identifier is a user generated value that should allow the identification of individual tracks (for example, path/filename) or an ID&#160;that can be externally looked up.</p>
        <p class="tip">When adding an album GDO to Playlist that resulted from a CD TOC lookup, Gracenote recommends adding all tracks from the album to Playlist individually. To do this, call gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_gdo() twice for each track on the album. The first call should pass the album GDO for the identifier (to allow Playlist to gather album data), and the second call should pass the respective track GDO from the album using the same identifier used in the first call. This will ensure Playlist adds full album and track data to the collection summary for each track on the album, which supports querying the Playlist Collection with both track and album level attributes.</p>
        <h3>How Playlist Gathers Data</h3>
        <p>When given an album GDO, Playlist gathers any necessary album data and then traverses to the matched track and gathers the necessary data from that track. This data is stored for the given identifier. If no matched track is part of the album GDO, no track data is gathered. Playlist also gathers data from both the album and track contributors as detailed below.</p>
        <p>When given a track GDO, Playlist gathers any necessary data from the track, but it is not able to gather any album-related data (such as album title). Playlist also gathers data from the track contributors as detailed below.</p>
        <p>When given a contributor GDO (or traversing into one from an album or track), Playlist gathers the necessary data from the contributor. If the contributor is a collaboration, data from both child contributors is gathered as well.</p>
        <p>For all other GDOs, Playlist attempts to gather the necessary data, but no other specific traversals are done automatically.</p>
        <h3>Adding List Elements to Collection&#160;Summaries</h3>
        <p>You can use genre and other list data (origin, era, and tempo) to add media items to playlists, by matching by string and adding the result to a collection summary. To search for list elements by string, use the gnsdk_manager_list_get_element_by_string() function. This API returns a gnsdk_list_element_handle_t, which can be passed to the gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_list_element() function to add the value to a collection summary.</p>
        <p class="note"><span class="note">Note:</span> When searching for a genre list element, the SDK can match many different genre variations in many different languages, regardless of the language specified when loading a locale.</p>
        <h2>Working with Local Storage</h2>
        <p>You can store and manage collection summaries in local storage. To store a collection summary, use the following function:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_storage_store_collection(playlist_collection);</pre>
        <p>To retrieve a collection summary from local storage, use the gnsdk_playlist_storage_count_collections() and gnsdk_playlist_storage_enum_collections() functions to retrieve all collections.</p>
        <p>Before Playlist can use a collection summary that has been retrieved from storage, it must be loaded into memory:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_storage_load_collection(collection_name,&amp;playlist_collection);</pre>
        <h2>Generating a Playlist Using More Like This</h2>
        <p>You can streamline your Playlist implementation by using the gnsdk_playlist_generate_morelikethis() function, which uses the "More Like This" algorithm to generate optimal playlist results and eliminates the need to create and validate Playlist Definition Language statements.</p>
        <p>You can set the following options when generating a More Like This Playlist, by using the 
gnsdk_playlist_morelikethis_option_set() function:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Option</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_TRACKS</td>
                    <td>The maximum number of results returned.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_PER_ARTIST</td>
                    <td>The maximum number of results per artist returned.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_PER_ALBUM</td>
                    <td>The maximum number of results per album returned; the value for this key must evaluate to a number greater than 0.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_RANDOM</td>
                    <td>The randomization seed value used in calculating a More Like This playlist. The value for this key must evaluate to a number greater than 0 (the recommended range is 1 - 100, but you can use any number). This number will be the seed for the randomization. You can re-create a playlist
  by choosing the same number for the randomization seed; choosing different numbers will create different playlists.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The following example demonstrates setting the More Like This options:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">
/*
 * Change the possible result set to contain a maximum of 30 tracks 
 */
gnsdk_playlist_morelikethis_option_set(
    playlist_collection,
    GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_TRACKS,
    "30"
    );

/*
 * Change the possible result set to contain a maximum of 10 tracks per artist 
 */
gnsdk_playlist_morelikethis_option_set( 
    playlist_collection,
    GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_PER_ARTIST,
    "0"
    );

/* 
 * Change the possible result set to contain a maximum of 5 tracks per album 
 */
gnsdk_playlist_morelikethis_option_set( 
    playlist_collection,
    GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_MAX_PER_ALBUM,
    "5"
    );

/* 
 * Change the random result to be 1, so that there is no randomization
 */
gnsdk_playlist_morelikethis_option_set( 
    playlist_collection,
    GNSDK_PLAYLIST_MORELIKETHIS_OPTION_RANDOM,
    "1"
    );</pre>
        <p>To generate a More Like This playlist, call the gnsdk_playlist_generate_morelikethis() function with a user handle, a playlist collection summary, and a seed GDO. A seed GDO&#160;can be any recognized media GDO, for example, the GDO of the track that is currently playing.</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_generate_morelikethis(
    user_handle, 
    playlist_collection, 
    h_gdo_seed, 
    &amp;playlist_results
    );</pre>
        <h2>Accessing Playlist Results</h2>
        <p>Once you have generated a playlist, you can iterate through the results using the gnsdk_playlist_results_count() and gnsdk_playlist_results_enum() functions. The results consist of a set of unique identifiers, which match the identifiers given to Playlist during the population of the collection summary. The application must match these identifiers to the physical media that they reference. </p>
        <h2>Working with Multiple Collection Summaries</h2>
        <p>Creating a playlist across multiple collections can be accomplished by using <i>joins</i>. Joins allow you to combine multiple collection summaries at run-time, so that they can be treated as one collection by the playlist generation functions. Joined collections can be used to generate More&#160;Like This and PDL-based playlists.  </p>
        <p>For example, if your application has created a playlist based on one device (collection 1), and another device is plugged into the system (collection 2), you might want to create a playlist based on both of these collections. This can be accomplished using the gnsdk_playlist_collection_join() function:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">gnsdk_playlist_collection_join(collection_handle1, collection_handle2);</pre>
        <p>Calling this function joins collection 2 into collection 1. The collection 1 handle now represents the joined collection, and can be used to generate the playlist. </p>
        <p>You can also enumerate identifiers across joined collections by using the gnsdk_playlist_collection_ident_count() and gnsdk_playlist_collection_ident_enum() functions.</p>
        <p class="warning">Joins are run-time constructs for playlist generation that support seamless identifier enumeration across all contained collections.  They do not directly support  the addition or removal of GDOs, synchronization, or serialization across all collections in a join. To perform any of these operations, you can use the join management functions to access the individual collections and operate on them separately.</p>
        <p>To remove a collection from a join, call the gnsdk_playlist_collection_join_remove() function.</p>
        <h3>Join Performance and Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Creating a join is very efficient and has minimal CPU and memory requirements. When collections are joined, <span class="GNVariablesProductName">GNSDK for Desktop</span> internally sets references between them, rather than recreating them. Creating, deleting, and recreating joined collections when needed can be an effective and high-performing way to manage collections.</p>
        <p>The original handles for the individual collections remain functional, and you can continue to operate on them in tandem with the joined collection, if needed. If you release an original handle for a collection that has been entered into a joined collection, the joined collections will continue to be functional as long as the collection handle representing the join remains valid.</p>
        <p>A good practice for managing the joining of collections is to create a new collection handle that represents the join, and then join all existing collections into this handle. This helps remove ambiguity as to which original collection is the parent collection representing the join.</p>
        <h2>Synchronizing Collection Summaries</h2>
        <p>Collection summaries must be refreshed whenever items in the user's media collection are modified. For example, if you've created a collection summary based on the media on a particular device, and the media on that device changes, your application must synchronize the collection summary.</p>
        <p>Synchronization of a collection summary to physical media involves two steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Adding all existing (current and new) unique identifiers, using the gnsdk_playlist_collection_sync_ident_add() function, which Playlist collates.</li>
            <li value="2">Calling gnsdk_playlist_collection_sync_process() to process the current and new identifiers and using the callback function to add or remove identifiers to or from the collection summary.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Iterating the Physical Media</h3>
        <p>The first step in synchronizing is to iterate through the physical media, calling the gnsdk_playlist_collection_sync_ident_add() function for each media item. For each media item, pass the unique identifier associated with the item to the function. The unique identifiers used must match the identifiers that were used to create the collection summary initially.</p>
        <h3>Processing the Collection</h3>
        <p>After preparing a collection summary for synchronization using gnsdk_playlist_collection_sync_ident_add(), call gnsdk_playlist_collection_sync_process() to synchronize the collection summary's data. During processing, the callback function gnsdk_playlist_update_callback_fn() will be called for each difference between the physical media and the collection summary. So the callback function will be called once for each new media item, and once for each media item that has been deleted from the collection. The callback function should add new and delete old identifiers from the collection summary.</p>
        <h2 class="example">Example: Implementing a Playlist</h2>
        <p>This example demonstrates using the Playlist APIs to create More Like This and custom playlists.</p>
