An auto-playlist is a playlist generated automatically by software. This distinction only describes the initial creation of the playlist; once created and saved, all that matters to the end-user is whether the playlist is static (and usually editable) or dynamic (and non-editable).

There is no way to resolve these cases automatically as there is no other information on the CD to distinguish between them. So the user must be presented with a dialog box to allow a choice between the alternatives.
