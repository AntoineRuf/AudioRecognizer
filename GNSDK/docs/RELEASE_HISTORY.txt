RELEASE NOTES:
See Release Notes for more details.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.7: 2015/07/06

* Fixed Java Security Vulnerability (CVE-2015-2004) in the Java layer of the GNSDK that is
  potentially exploitable if your application serializes GnException and stores or
  transmits the serialized object.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.6: 2015/06/19

* Fixed an issue in SQLite support in which deletion of a large number of items could
  subsequently lead to errors. Deletion of a large number of items could occur, for
  example, during background cache management processes.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.5: 2015/05/15

* Changes applied to GNSDK 3.07.4 in order to allow use of an external SQLite library
  could lead to database contention. Under some conditions this could cause an application
  to crash. This has been fixed.
* Fixed a potential crash when performing online queries with multiple threads in
  parallel.
* Fixed a potential crash in MusicID-Stream. This could occur if an identify was cancelled
  very soon after it was issued. This could happen whether the identify was requested in
  manual query mode or under the hood in automatic query mode.
* Fixed an issue which resulted in an extra network trip to fetch all data available to
  MusicID-Stream queries, resulting in additional bandwidth.
* Fixed an issue in which client side load balancing was not available when an http
  proxy was in use.
* Fixed an issue in Playlist generation which impacted the use of LIMIT clauses for tracks
  in the collection summary in which the attribute to which the LIMIT was applied was
  missing.
* Fixed a bug in the handling of GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_IDENT for contributor objects.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.4: 2015/04/13

* GNSDK has SQLite built in. This was causing symbol clashes in some cases where
  developers were using another instance of SQLite in their application. These symbol
  clashes have been eliminated.
* In addition, a new API has been added that will force GNSDK to use an
  application specified SQLite instance. The new API is
  - gnsdk_storage_sqlite_use_external_library(Ö)
  This might be desired, for example, to allow sharing databases across processes. Note
  that in order to use GNSDK with an external version of SQLite, that instance of
  SQLite may need to be built with the following options
    SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA
    SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY
    SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED
* Fixed an issue in which Playlist Collection summaries generated with 3.07 version 
  were not compatible with earlier GNSDK 3.06 releases 
* Fixed Link Errors for linux_armhf-32 libs
* Fixed an issue in which GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_FULL_RESULT was returning a True value if
  Classical data was missing even in cases where Classical data was not requested. This
  key now only returns True for missing Classical data if Classical data was requested and
  expected.
* Fixed an issue in the C# layer in which an invalid argument exception would be thrown
  when accessing GnMusicIdFileInfoManager values with non ASCII UTF8 characters.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.3: 2015/03/10

* MusicID Stream
  - Fixed an issue in which the audio quality setting was sometimes ignored.

* Playlist
  - Fixed a crash when adding to a pre-existing stored playlist collection which had
    exactly 3 entries when loaded.

* Networking
  - Fixed issues with GNSDK_USER_OPTION_NETWORK_TIMEOUT. A recently introduced issue
    caused this setting to be ignored. In addition, setting it to a very low value, in the
    low millisecond range, would cause the timeout to be essentially infinite.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.2: 2015/01/14

* Rolled back modifications to language preferences for online TOC, Text and file based
  fingerprint queries. The modifications were causing issues in some regions in which the
  preferred result was being filtered out. This did not impact streaming fingerprint
  queries and so the language preference improvements are still in place for those.

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.1: 2014/10/31

Issues fixed in GNSDK 3.07.1
* Removed some diagnostic output which should not have been in release builds.
* Wrappers
  - GnVideo.FindContributors(gnsdk_cstr_t textInput, GnVidoeSearchType searchType)
    has been deprecated. A new method, taking a search field as well, has been added
    GnVideo.FindContributors(gnsdk_cstr_t textInput, GnVideoSearchField searchField,
                             GnVidoeSearchType searchType)

----------------------------------------------------------  
3.07.0: 2014/10/14

New in GNSDK 3.07
* Gracenote Rhythm
  - Rhythm is an online Gracenote service that provides track recommendations
    based on a seed (e.g. artist, album or track). Once a seed has been provided 
    to the Rhythm API, the application can continue to request additional
    tracks. The tracks returned may have links to online music catalogs to
    support playback. The Gracenote Rhythm API supports actions such as “like”,
    “dislike”, “played” and “skipped” which will dynamically modify tracks
    returned on subsequent fetches.

Changes in GNSDK 3.07.0
* Data Model
  - The key GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_DISPLAY_SCRIPT_DISPLAY, which was to be used to
    return the display string of the script of a result, e.g. Latin, has been
    removed pending provision of supporting data. The key
    GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_DISPLAY_SCRIPT, which returns the script code, is still
    available.
  - Added the following fields
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_BIRTH_PLACE_LANGUAGE
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_DEATH_PLACE_LANGUAGE
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_CURRENT_MATCH_POSITION_MS
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_MATCH_DURATION_MS
    . GNSDK_GDO_CHILD_TITLE_REGIONAL
    . GNSDK_GDO_CHILD_TITLE_REGIONAL_LOCALE
  - Deprecated the following keys
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_TRACK_MATCHED_POSITION.
      Use GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_MATCH_POSITION_MS instead.
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_ACR_MATCH_POSITION_ACTUAL.
      Use GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_MATCH_POSITION_MS instead.
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_ACR_MATCH_POSITION.
      Use GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_MATCH_POSITION_MS instead.
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_ADJUSTED_MATCH_POSITION_MS.
      Use GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_CURRENT_POSITION_MS instead.
    . GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_ACR_MATCH_POSITION_ADJUSTED.
      Use GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_CURRENT_POSITION_MS instead.
* Locales and Lists
  - Logic has been added to prefer query results most consistent with the set
    locale in cases where there is more than 1 match.
  - The Region GNSDK_REGION_NORTH_AMERICA has been deprecated. Use
    GNSDK_REGION_US instead.
* MusicID
  - GNSDK_MUSICID_FP_DATA_TYPE_GNFPX has been deprecated. Use
    GNSDK_MUSICID_FP_DATA_TYPE_STREAM3 or GNSDK_MUSICID_FP_DATA_TYPE_STREAM6
    instead.
  - GNSDK_MUSICID_FP_DATA_TYPE_CMX has been deprecated. Use
    GNSDK_MUSICID_FP_DATA_TYPE_FILE instead.
* MusicID-Stream
  There have been numerous changes to the MusicID-Stream API. Note that much of
  this API is marked as Experimental and so may change in future releases.
  - Renamed some enumeration values from gnsdk_mids_* to gnsdk_musicidstream_*
    for consistency.
  - Added presets to set up MusicID-Stream for different use cases. Currently
    microphone and radio use cases are supported. This impacts traits such as
    the assumed audio quality.
    . Added a “preset” argument to gnsdk_musicidstreamp_channel_create().
  - The 5 GNSDK_MUSICIDSTREAM_AUDIO_QUALITY_ option values have been
    replaced by 2 option values, MICROPHONE and TUNER.
  - Added gnsdk_musicidstream_channel_identify_cancel() to cancel identification
  - Added an operating mode in which recognition is carried on in the
    background. This is enabled via a new API,
    gnsdk_musicidstream_channel_automatic_set() and is primarily intended to
    support Radio use cases. In automatic mode, the application can also send
    events to a MusicID-Stream channel such as broadcast metadata changes.
  - Added query flag argument to gnsdk_musicidstream_channel_identify().
    Currently only supports GNSDK_MUSICIDSTREAM_QUERY_FLAG_ASYNC.
  - APIs added for support of broadcast metadata inputs.
* Playlist
  -  Added a new attribute, GNSDK_PLAYLIST_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_TRACK, to playlist
     entries.
  - Added support for adding empty entries to a Playlist Collection Summaries
    via a new API gnsdk_playlist_collection_add_ident().
* Video
  - Added GNSDK_VIDEO_OPTION_ENABLE_MINIMAL_DATA which currently reduces the
    number of Credits returned from a Video Contributor query.
  - Fixed an issue in which the Official name of a contributor could be missing
    if it was not in the same as the configured locale.
* Platform Support
  - Added libraries
    . android_armeabi
    . android_x86
    . linux_armhf-32 : 32 bit ARM linux with hard floating point support
  - Removed libraries for Winrt and Windows Phone 8. Please contact Gracenote 
    Global Services & Solutions team if you need to develop on these platforms.
* Other Improvements
  - Made cancellations from query callbacks return Warning instead of Error from
    all states. Up to now cancellation would sometimes return an error and other
    times return a warning.
  - GNSDK_MANAGER_STORAGE_LISTSCACHE has been deprecated. Please use
    GNSDK_MANAGER_STORAGE_LISTS instead.
  - Added a new value, gnsdk_status_cancelled, to the status callback
    enumeration type, gnsdk_status_t. This new value indicates to the callback
    function that a transaction or query has been cancelled.
  - Added GNSDK_MANAGER_STORAGE_TEMP to set the location of a new storage for
    internal use by GNSDK.
  - Added iOS and android support for the fp_generation utility application. 

Issues fixed in GNSDK 3.07.0
  - Fixed an issue in which after calling
    gnsdk_storage_sqlite_option_set( GNSDK_STORAGE_SQLITE_OPTION_CACHE_FILESIZE,
    <value>) a new cache was created, the new cache would not respect the file
    size limit.
  - Fixed an in issue in which Android applications using the C API to the GNSDK
    were required to include the gabi++ library included in the Android NDK.
    This dependency was not necessary and is no longer required in 3.07. Android
    applications using the GNSDK C++ and Java APIs will require the gabi++
    library from the Android NDK.
  - Fixed an issue in which GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_DISPLAY_LANGUAGE_DISPLAY was
    returning the incorrect field. The language display string returned with
    this key is now the language corresponding to the code returned by
    GNSDK_GDO_VALUE_DISPLAY_LANGUAGE.
  - Fixed an issue in C++ in which cancel from MusicID was not always effective.
  - Fixed an issue in which queries against the cache using
    GNSDK_LOOKUP_MODE_ONLINE_CACHEONLY would create a cache if none existed.
  - Fixed a potential crash when executing gnsdk_musicidfile_query_do_albumid()
    could crash of the flag GNSDK_MUSICIDFILE_QUERY_FLAG_AGGRESSIVE was set.
  - Fixed a crashing bug in the query status callback. If a query was aborted
    when the query state was gnsdk_status_complete, then library shutdown with
    gnsdk_manager_shutdown() would crash.
  - Fixed an issue in which the Official name of a contributor resulting from an
    online query was missing in some cases where the official language was not
    the same as the locale language.
  - Improved error reporting for querying with silent stream fingerprints.
    Includes a new error code: GNSDKERR_SilentAudio
  - Fixed an issue in with Contributor GNUIDs in MusicID. in which Album and
    Track IDs were not being properly propagated to Contributor.
